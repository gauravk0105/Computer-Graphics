Ellispe Algorithm

1.TO RUN IN LINUX

To compile :
    --> Go to the folder
    --> And Type: 
            g++  ellipse_all_octant.cpp  -lglut -lGL -lGLU
            OR
            g++  ellipse_first_octant.cpp  -lglut -lGL -lGLU

    where master.cpp is the main file
    
To run:
    --> Type:
            ./a.out


User has to input : Enter the Major and Minor Length   


include file : 

        ellipse_all_octant.h == contain code for ellispe drawing in all octant
        ellipse_first_octant.h == contain code for ellispe drawing in first octant
